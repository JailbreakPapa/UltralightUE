# Supported Platforms

Currently Supported Platforms with the plugin are: Windows. 

*Please Note*: Any platform, NDA, or not, can be added with the plugin with little, to no changes. 

If you do prefer to get access for the NDA Platforms, instead of modifying it your self, feel free to contact us.

You *Will* have to be a "partner" of the requested platform (If it is a Console/NDA Platform)
